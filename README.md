# 🌳 GreenSpace: Report, Predict, Protect

Welcome to **GreenSpace**, an innovative digital platform that empowers communities to report environmental issues, predict potential disasters, and get rewarded for their contributions to protecting our planet.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Report & Earn**: Snap a photo of an environmental issue (like a pile of garbage or a potential flood hazard), report it through our app, and earn *GreenSpace Points* (GSP) as a reward.
* **AI-Powered Disaster Alerts**: Our intelligent system analyzes reports, weather data, and satellite imagery to predict potential disasters like floods and forest fires in *real-time*.
* **Decentralized Ecosystem**: Built on the *Internet Computer Protocol* (ICP), all reports and transactions are recorded transparently and securely on the blockchain.
* **Modern Interface**: From the mobile app to the landing page, we've designed a user-friendly and visually engaging experience.

## 🤖 AI & Data for Disaster Prediction

We integrate several AI and data services to provide accurate and rapid predictions:

1.  **[Groq](https://groq.com/)**: Used to generate predictive analyses and narratives from collected environmental data. Its speed allows us to deliver warnings in *real-time*.
2.  **[Azure AI Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-vision)**: Analyzes user-uploaded images to identify objects, severity levels, and the context of environmental reports.
3.  **[WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)**: Provides up-to-date weather data, including precipitation, wind speed, and humidity, to enhance the accuracy of our disaster prediction models.
